Linear Regression:
y = mx + c

In ML,
y = wx + b
w-weight
b-bias

Linear Expression is just an approximate value of something in a system.

System of Linear expressions would give the closest answer possible.


Difference between Linear vs. Non-Linear system of equations.
- Linear:     U can multiply the weights with some numbers and adding the constants. (Straight line)
- Non-Linear: We cannot just multiply with weights and add constants. (Could be exponential)


Solution Types: [System of Equations]
a. Unique Solution    / Complete      / Non-Singular / Lines Intersect
b. Infinite Solutions / Redundant     / Singular     / Lines overlap each other
c. No Solution	      / Contradictory / Singular     / Parallel Lines


System of Equations as a Plane:
- Unique Solution    - Point on a Plane
- Infinite Solutions - Line on a Plane
- No Solution	     - Plane on Plane


MATRIX:
- Linear Dependence:
	- If the rows are dependent on each other -> Linearly Dependent		[Some relation between rows]
	- If the rows are not depenedent on each other -> Linearly Independent	[No relation between rows]


- Determinant:

Det=0 -> Singular Matrix
Det not =0 -> Non-singular Matrix

	- Calculate for 2x2 Matrix [ad-bc=determinant]
	- Calculate for 3x3 Matrix []
		[ a b c ]
		[ d e f ]
		[ g h i ]3x3
		
		Example 1: [Calculate the determinant]
		[ 1 0 1 ]
		[ 0 1 0 ]
		[ 3 3 3 ]3x3
		
		Determinant -> 1x1x3 + 0x0x3 + 1x0x3 - 3x1x1 - 0x0x3 - 1x3x0 => 3 + 0 + 0 - 3 - 0 - 0
									     => 3 - 3
									     => 0
									     => Thus, it is a Singular Matrix

		
		Example 2: [Calculate the determinant]
		[ 1 1 1 ]
		[ 1 1 2 ]
		[ 0 0 -1]3x3
		
		Determinant -> 1x1x-1 + 1x2x0 + 1x1x0 - 0x1x1 - 1x1x-1 - 1x0x2 => -1 + 0 + 0 - 0 - 0 - (-1)
									       => -1 + 1
									       => 0
									       => Thus, it is a Non-Singular Matrix
