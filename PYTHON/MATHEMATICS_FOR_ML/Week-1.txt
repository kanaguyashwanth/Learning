Linear Regression:
y = mx + c

In ML,
y = wx + b
w-weight
b-bias

Linear Expression is just an approximate value of something in a system.

System of Linear expressions would give the closest answer possible.

Difference between Linear vs. Non-Linear system of equations.
- Linear:     U can multiply the weights with some numbers and adding the constants. (Straight line)
- Non-Linear: We cannot just multiply with weights and add constants. (Could be exponential)

Solution Types: [System of Equations]
a. Unique Solution    / Complete      / Non-Singular / Lines Intersect
b. Infinite Solutions / Redundant     / Singular     / Lines overlap each other
c. No Solution	      / Contradictory / Singular     / Parallel Lines


System of Equations as a Plane:
- Unique Solution    - Point on a Plane
- Infinite Solutions - Line on a Plane
- No Solution	     - Plane on Plane
