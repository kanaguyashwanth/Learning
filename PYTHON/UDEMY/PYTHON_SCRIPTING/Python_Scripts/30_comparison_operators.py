    to find the ASCII code of 'a' 
'''

''' In python terminal, we can type, chr(45) to

'''

#TRY THESE OUT

''' 'a'<'b'     ---> True
    'aa'<'b'    ---> True, becaues the left side first char is compared with the right side first char.
    'abc'<'aac' ---> False, skips first char since both are same and starts comparing the second character
    'abc'>'aac' ---> True
