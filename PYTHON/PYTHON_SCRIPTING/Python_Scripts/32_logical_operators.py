#LOGICAL OPERATORS: (OUTPUT is always either TRUE/FALSE)
''' 
    AND
    OR
    NOT
    ALL - Multiple AND
    ANY - Multiple OR

'''

#Note:
'''
    If we have 4 conditions, then we need 4-1 AND/OR operators.  
'''

#EXAMPLES: [Python Terminal]
'''
    >>> 2<3 and 4<5 and 5<6 and 6<7   --->   True
    >>> all([2<3, 4<5, 5<6, 6<7])     --->   True  (Can be used when there are multiple AND, clubbed together)
    >>>
