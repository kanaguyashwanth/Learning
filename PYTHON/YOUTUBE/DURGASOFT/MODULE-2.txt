FEATURES OF PYTHON:
-------------------
1. Java has 53 keywords, Python has 30 keywords - less lines of code
2. FREEWARE, OPEN-SOURCE - no license to run python. OPEN SOURCE - we can customize python and release our own versions of python.
3. HIGH LEVEL LANGUAGE   - Very easy to understand, memory-level activities, machine-level activities are taken care by Python. C# / Python / .NET -> All are HIGH LEVEL LANGUAGES ONLY
4. PLATFORM INDEPENDANT  - Can be run anywhere on any OS (WORA) - Write Once Read Anywhere
5. PORTABILITY           - Moving code from one platform to another machine like Linux without making any change in code.
6. DYNAMICALLY TYPED     - Not required to type the values, based on the values the type will be considered.
7. PROCEDURE&OBJECT ORI. - Without(with just functions) and with(with classes & object), we can write the program. JAVA is Object-Oriented. C is Procedure-Oriented
8. INTERPRETED           - It is not required to compile unlike JAVA, it can be run without compiling first. Python interpreter takes care of the compilation(if compilation fails, interpreter raises errors.)
9. EXTENSIBLE            - We can use other language programs in Python.
	                 - If we want to improve the performance by writing it in other programs and running it through python.

10. EMBEDDED             - We can use Python in any other languages. Compatible with other languages too.
11. EXTENSIVE LIBRARY    - Lots of libraries are available already


LIMITATIONS:
------------
1. PERFORMANCE - Interpreted
2. MOBILE APPLICATIONS - Bad performance










IDENTIFIERS IN PYTHON:
----------------------
- variable name, class name, method name

x=10

def f1():
    pass

class Test(Exception)



cash = 10 (Valid)
ca$h = 10 (Invalid, valid in JAVA)



RULES TO DEFINE IDENTIFIERS:
----------------------------
1. Alphabet (both upper and lower case)
   Digits (0 to 9)
   Underscore (_)
a to z, A to Z, 0-9, _

2. Identifiers should NOT start with DIGITS

3. Identifiers are CASE-SENSITIVE

4. KEYWORDS cannot be used as Identifiers

5. NO LENGTH LIMIT for Identifiers





IDENTIFIER TYPES:
-----------------
- Normal (x=10, cash=100, abc123=4)
- Private          (_x)       - Identifier starting with underscore is a PRIVATE IDENTIFIER
- Highly Private   (__x)      - Identifier starting with double underscores is a HIGHLY PRIVATE IDENTIFIER
- Language-defined (__name__) - Identifier starting and ending with two identifiers is a LANGUAGE-DEFINED IDENTIFIER
