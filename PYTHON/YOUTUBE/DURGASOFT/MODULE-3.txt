Features of Python:

1. Java has 53 keywords, Python has 30 keywords - less lines of code
2. FREEWARE - no license to run python. OPEN SOURCE - we can customize python and release our own versions of python.
3. HIGH LEVEL LANGUAGE - Very easy to understand, memory-level activities, machine-level activities are taken care by Python. C# / Python / .NET -> All are HIGH LEVEL LANGUAGES ONLY
4. PLATFORM INDEPENDANT - Can be run anywhere on any OS (WORA) - Write Once Read Anywhere
5. PORTABILITY - Moving code from one platform to another machine like Linux without making any change in code.
6. DYNAMICALLY TYPED - Not required to type the values, based on the values the type will be considered.
7. BOTH PROCEDURE-ORIENTED AND OBJECT-ORIENTED - Without(with just functions) and with(with classes & object), we can write the program. JAVA is Object-Oriented. C is Procedure-Oriented
8. INTERPRETED - It is not required to compile unlike JAVA, it can be run without compiling first. Python interpreter takes care of the compilation(if compilation fails, interpreter raises errors.)
9. EXTENSIBLE - We can use other language programs in Python.
	      - If we want to improve the performance by writing it in other programs and running it through python.
10. EMBEDDED - We can use Python in any other languages. Compatible with other languages too.
11. EXTENSIVE LIBRARY - Lots of libraries are available already


LIMITATIONS:
1. PERFORMANCE - Interpreted
2. MOBILE APPLICATIONS - Bad performance
